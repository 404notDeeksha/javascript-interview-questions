1. ### What is javascript?
   Javascript is a programming language which is used to convert static web apps into interactive dynamic ones.

2. ### What are its features?

   It is _lightweight_ & _versatile_. <br/> It is a _dynamically typed language_ (data type of variable is decided at runtime).<br/> It is _single threaded_.<br/> It is _weakly typed_ (variable types are not enforced) & _interpreted language_.<br/> It is _Event Driven_, _asynchronous_, & has _Rich ecosystem_.

3. ### What is role of js engine?

   Js engine is a program in web browser which executes js code. In order to enable it, use js file under `<script>` tag in index.html file. <br/> Chrome - V8 <br/> Firefox - spiderMonkey <br/> Safari - Js core <br/> Edge - Chakra

4. ### What are the different data types in JavaScript?

   Javascript has basically 2 data types: <br/> <br/> A.**Primitive**: immutable, store single values:<br/> 1. **Number**: represents integers & floating-point numbers. eg: 7, 5.48. <br/> 2. **String**: represents sequence of characters. eg: "Hello".<br/> 3. **BigInt**: represents integers with arbitrary precision. number ends with n. Can represent any size of number, limited by memory. eg: 123456123456n <br/> 4. **Boolean**: represents logical values - true or false. <br/> 5. **Undefined**: variable that has been declared but isnt assigned a value. eg. let value; <br/> 6. **Null**: represents _Intentional_ absence of any object value. eg: let value = null; <br/> 7. **Symbol**: represent unique , immutable values, often used as object property keys.<br/><br/> B. **Non-Primitive** : <br/>**Object**: Used to store collection of data & more complex entities. eg: Objects(key-value pairs), Arrays(ordered collections), Functions, Dates, Maps, Sets, Regular Expressions(RegExp) etc.

5. ### What is Imperative & Declarative Programming in Javascript?

    **Imperative** : This style of programming gives step by step instructions for how to achieve goals. main focus is on sequence of operations & control flow.<br/>eg: C, Python, Java, DSA use this approach.<br/><br/> `let results = [];`<br/>`for (let num of collection) {`<br/>    `if (num % 2 !== 0) {`<br/>    `results.push(num);`<br/>`}`<br/>`}`<br/><br/> **Declarative**:  This style of programming focuses on desired outcome & letting system decide how to do it. <br/> eg: SQL, HTML< React's JSX use this format.<br/><br/> `let results = collection.filter(num => num % 2 !== 0);`<br/>

6. ### What is Client side Rendering & Server side Rendering?  

   In *Client Side Rendering*, *browser* is responsible for rendering the web page. The server sends a basic HTML File & a Js bundle (after site has been deployed on a server). Browser runs the Js bundle which generates & displays UI. After Initial load, all updates & navigation happen in browser using Js. without reloading entire page. <br/><ul><li> It reduces Server load, as server mainly handles API/ data requests & not page rendering. <li> It leads to Interactive , dynamic user Experience, smoother navigation & real time updates.<li>It also means slower initial load times, because browser needs to download & exceute Js before showing content & SEO Challenges as search engines may find indexing content difficult on client-side.</ul> <br/><br/>In *Server Side Rendering*, the server *generates the complete HTML for each page* and sends it to the browser. The browser *displays the page immediately*, and then JavaScript can take over for further interactivity. <br/> For each new page request, server renders React Component into HTML which is then sended over to client. Browser displays this HTML & React *hydrates* it to make it interactive. <ul><li> This means *faster Initial load times*, as browser recieves ready- to - go HTML.  <li> It means *SEO optimisation* as search engines can index pre-rendered content. <li> Better experience on slow networks as browser does less work here. <li> It also means, *Slower Navigation* as each new page needs a round trip to server, more server resources & more complex development & deployment.</ul><br/><br/> Note: **Hydration** is only used with SSR. In this, when HTML from server is loaded by browser on client side, React *matches it with its V-DOM*, attaches *event handlers & listeners* to existing HTML elements & *takes over DOM management* from here onwards. It brings interactivity & performance in SSR apps as full UI re-render is not needed & SEO optimisation also takes place.

7. ### What is scope in Js?

   Scope means *current context* of *execution in which variables, objects & functions* are *accessible* in the code. <br/> <ol><li> **Global scope**: Variables declared outside of any function or block are in global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere. <li> **Function (Local) Scope**: Variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function. They cannot be accessed from anywhere outside the function.<br/> Variables declared with var data type are function scoped. <li> **Block Scope**: Introduced in ES6, Variables declared with let and const inside a block (eg., within {}, for loops, if statements, etc.) are only accessible within that block. <li> Module Scope: While using Js modules, variables declared inside a module are only accessible within that module unless explicitly exported.</ol><br/> Note: <ul><li>Scopes work in hierarchy. Inner(child) scopes can access Outer(Parent) scope, not vice versa. <li> Variable Shadowing: Variables under same name can be declared under different scopes. </ul><br/> `let x = 1; // Global scope` <br/><br/> `function exampleFunction() {`      <br/> 
   `let x = 2; // Function scope` <br/> 
    `if (true) {` <br/>
        `let x = 3; // Block scope` <br/> 
           `console.log(x); // 3` <br/>
             `}` <br/>
  `console.log(x); // 2` <br/>
  `}` <br/><br/>`exampleFunction();` <br/>
  `console.log(x); // 1` <br/>

8. ### What is difference between var, let & const?

   | Feature         | var                                | let                                   | const                                      |
   |-----------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
   | Scope           | Function-scoped or global-scoped   | Block-scoped                          | Block-scoped                               |
   | Hoisting        | Yes (initialized as `undefined` at top of its scope)   | Yes (but not initialized, Reference Err due to "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) applies)| Yes (but not initialized, TDZ applies)     |
   | Redeclaration   | Allowed within the same scope      | Not allowed in the same scope         | Not allowed in the same scope              |
   | Reassignment    | Allowed                            | Allowed                               | Not allowed (value is constant)            |
   | Initialization  | Optional                           | Optional                              | Required                                   |
   | Use Case        | Legacy code, old browsers          | Modern JS, variables that change      | Constants, values that never change        |
   
   **Hoisting** <br/>
   **var**: <br/> It is an implicit(default) keyword.<br/>
   `console.log(a); // Output: undefined`<br/>
   `var a = 10; // or a=10;`<br/>
   `console.log(a); // Output: 10`<br/><br/>
   **let**: <br/>
   `console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization`<br/>
   `let b = 20;`<br/>
   `console.log(b); // This line won't run`<br/><br/>
   **const**: <br/>
   `console.log(c); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'c' before initialization` <br/>
   `const c = 30;`<br/>
   `console.log(c); // This line won't run`<br/>

   Tricky Question: 
   ```js
   for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
   setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1);
   }

   for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
   setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1);
   }
   //Output 333 012
   ```

9. ### What is Hoisting?

   Hoisting is a *Js mechanism* where interpreter appears to *move declarations of variables, functions, classes or imports* to the *top of their scope* before code is executed. <ul> <li>It means certain variables, functions can be accessed before they are actually declared in code. <li>**Variable Declarations** : Only declarations are hoisted & not initializations. <li> **Function Declarations**: These are fully hoisted, both function's name & body are available throughout the scope where they are declared.<li> **Class Declarations**: They are hoisted but not initialized, so referencing them before their declaration causes a ReferenceError.</ul><br/> Note: Hoisted means the code runs well at that point of flow (mostly declarations- let,var,const). <br/> It makes code more flexible & readable.  <br/> <br/> **Function Hoisting**:
   ```js 
   foo(); // "Hello"
   function foo() {
   console.log("Hello");
   }
   ``` 

10. ### What are stages of Js Code processing?

      Stages are: <br/> <ol> <li> **Parsing**: Js engine first parses the code (it reads Js source code, & checks for syntax errors. It converts code into structured format (DSA) called Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)). Parsing ensures code is valid for further processing. <li> **Compilation/Interpretation** : modern Js engines use mix of JIT compilation & interpretation. Engine converts parsed code into machine code/ bytecode which computer can execute. This step involves optimisation for faster execution. <li> **Execution Context Creation**: Before running the code, the engine creates an execution context. This is an environment where the code will run, including memory for variables and functions. It is of 2 main types: <br/> <ol> <li> 1. **Global Execution Context** (for code outside functions). <li> 2. **Function Execution Context** (created each time a function is called).</ol> <li> **Memory Allocation (Creation Phase)** : In each execution context, the engine performs a memory allocation phase (also called the "creation phase"). It sets up the variable environment, allocating space for variables and functions, and hoisting declarations as needed.  <li> **Code Execution (Execution Phase)** : The engine then executes the code line by line. It assigns values to variables, evaluates expressions, and runs function calls. <li> **Call Stack Management**: As functions are called, execution contexts are pushed onto the call stack (since Js is single threaded language). When a function finishes, its context is popped off the stack. <li> **Handling Asynchronous Code (Event Loop)**: For asynchronous operations (like setTimeout, Promises, AJAX), the engine interacts with the browserâ€™s Web APIs, callback queue, and microtask queue.The event loop ensures that asynchronous callbacks are executed when the call stack is empty. </ol>
