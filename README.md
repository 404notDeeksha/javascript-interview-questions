1. ### What is javascript?
   Javascript is a programming language which is used to convert static web apps into interactive dynamic ones.
2. ### What are its features?

   It is _lightweight_ & _versatile_. <br/> It is a _dynamically typed language_ (data type of variable is decided at runtime).<br/> It is _single threaded_.<br/> It is _weakly typed_ (variable types are not enforced) & _interpreted language_.<br/> It is _Event Driven_, _asynchronous_, & has _Rich ecosystem_.

3. ### What is role of js engine?

   Js engine is a program in web browser which executes js code. In order to enable it, use js file under `<script>` tag in index.html file. <br/> Chrome - V8 <br/> Firefox - spiderMonkey <br/> Safari - Js core <br/> Edge - Chakra

4. ### What are the different data types in JavaScript?

   Javascript has basically 2 data types: <br/> <br/> A.**Primitive**: immutable, store single values:<br/> 1. **Number**: represents integers & floating-point numbers. eg: 7, 5.48. <br/> 2. **String**: represents sequence of characters. eg: "Hello".<br/> 3. **BigInt**: represents integers with arbitrary precision. number ends with n. Can represent any size of number, limited by memory. eg: 123456123456n <br/> 4. **Boolean**: represents logical values - true or false. <br/> 5. **Undefined**: variable that has been declared but isnt assigned a value. eg. let value; <br/> 6. **Null**: represents _Intentional_ absence of any object value. eg: let value = null; <br/> 7. **Symbol**: represent unique , immutable values, often used as object property keys.<br/><br/> B. **Non-Primitive** : <br/>**Object**: Used to store collection of data & more complex entities. eg: Objects(key-value pairs), Arrays(ordered collections), Functions, Dates, Maps, Sets, Regular Expressions(RegExp) etc.

5. ### What is Imperative & Declarative Programming in Javascript?

    **Imperative** : This style of programming gives step by step instructions for how to achieve goals. main focus is on sequence of operations & control flow.<br/>eg: C, Python, Java, DSA use this approach.<br/> let results = [];
    for (let num of collection) {
    if (num % 2 !== 0) {
    results.push(num);
    }
    }
 <br/> **Declarative**:  This style of programming focuses on desired outcome & letting system decide how to do it. <br/> eg: SQL, HTML< React's JSX use this format.<br/> let results = collection.filter(num => num % 2 !== 0);
