   Javascript has basically 2 data types: <br/> <br/> A.**Primitive**: immutable, store single values:<br/> 1. **Number**: represents integers & floating-point numbers. eg: 7, 5.48. <br/> 2. **String**: represents sequence of characters. eg: "Hello".<br/> 3. **BigInt**: represents integers with arbitrary precision. number ends with n.  Can represent any size of number, limited by memory. eg: 123456123456n <br/> 4. **Boolean**: represents logical values - true or false. <br/> 5. **Undefined**: variable that has been declared but isnt assigned a value. eg. let value; <br/> 6. **Null**: represents *Intentional* absence of any object value. eg: let value = null; <br/> 7. **Symbol**: represent unique , immutable values, often used as object property keys.<br/> B. **Non-Primitive** : <br/>**Object**: Used to store collection of data & more complex entities. eg: Objects(key-value pairs), Arrays(ordered collections), Functions, Dates, Maps, Sets, Regular Expressions(RegExp) etc.
